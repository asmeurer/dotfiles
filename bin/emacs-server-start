# This script starts one emacs server per terminal tab. This is necessary when
# using emacsclient with terminal emacs, because if more than one emacsclient
# instance is open pointing to the same daemon, it can cause hangs (emacs is
# not very good at concurrency).

# To use this, run
#
#     emacsclient -a 'emacs-server-start' -nw --socket-name=emacs-$TTY

# I recommend adding an alias for this in your bash profile, like
#
#     alias e="emacsclient -a 'emacs-server-start' -nw --socket-name=emacs-$TTY"

# Then
#
#     $ e file
#
# will start the daemon if it hasn't already been started for that terminal,
# and open emacs client in it. You can close emacsclient with C-x C-c as
# usual. To kill the daemon entirely, use M-x save-buffers-kill-emacs.

emacs -nw --daemon="emacs-$TTY"

# The extra start is to prevent emacsclient from freezing on startup. See
# https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/3370/emacs-daemon-frozen-when-started-with-emacsclient-file
emacsclient -n -nw --socket-name="emacs-$TTY"
emacsclient -nw --socket-name="emacs-$TTY" "$@"
