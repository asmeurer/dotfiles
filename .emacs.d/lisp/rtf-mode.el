;;; Commentary:

;; Major mode for viewing/editing RTF source.  I wrote this mostly for
;; the sake of syntax-highlighting, and for the {}-matching.  It offers
;; little else in the way of conveniences (like key shortcuts.)
;; (If are interested in such conveniences, email me.)
;;
;; I maintain a homepage for this mode, at http://interglacial.com/rtf/emacs/
;;
;; Note that this mode doesn't (yet?) specially handle Help-RTF constructs.
;;
;; Also note that at time of writing (Oct 2006), Xemacs doesn't seem to
;; support some of the functions that this mode requires.  Sorry, Xemacs users!
;;
;; As with many programming modes, the default wrapping mechinisms
;; (whether via auto-fill-mode, or via fill-paragraph etc commands) do
;; not behave at all well.  So I've disabled wrapping as best I can,
;; so you don't end up corrupting documents.  Moreover, implementing
;; wrapping in RTF seems fairly difficult because of how spaces are
;; sometimes a significant token in RTF whereas newlines are not.
;;
;; For more on RTF, see http://interglacial.com/rtf/ and also be a chum and
;; go get this little book I wrote:  http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596004753
